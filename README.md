Added a new feature: Big Dungeons Blocks, under the "Dungeons" category, it'll change all chests, levers, buttons, wither essences and redstone keys to 1x1x1 blocks

Added a racism blocker to /rga -> RoseGoldAddons with 3 different modes (this is not meant to block ALL racism, just a few common phrases and bypasses)

Custom name peek is now a toggle instead

RoseGoldAddons no longer uses timechanger modid, but instead it's own modid (that's hidden from the server)

Minor improvements to DungeonESP
